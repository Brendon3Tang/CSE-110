#Who am I

**My name is Long Tang and my hometown is Guangzhou, Guangdong province, China. I am a junior transfer student majoring in Comupter Sicence. I spend my first two years in Foothill College, which located in Los Altos Hill near Mountain View. This is my first year in UCSD even though I have never been to San Diego. I wish I could walk at the campus soon.**

**As a programmer, I have learnt Java, C++, Assembly Language. I am learning HTML and CSS by my own right now. A lot of things happened since I jumped into upper divison courses, and I am struggling with it. Lacking practical experience in my career and coding ability are my current shortcomings, but I am doing my best to be a better programmer.**

**There is a proverb that I really agree with:**
> he best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.
